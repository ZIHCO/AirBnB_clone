# AirBnB clone - The console
## 1. Description
This is the first in The AirBnB Clone project; building the console(command intepreter). The command intepreter will take care of:
- Create a new object (ex: a new User or a new Place)
- Retrieve an object from a file, a database etc…
- Do operations on objects (count, compute stats, etc…)
- Update attributes of an object
- Destroy an object

In addition to the command intepreter, we created our data model by defining our super class (BaseModel)[] and its subclasses defined (here)[https://github.com/ZIHCO/AirBnB_clone/tree/master/models].
We have also taken care of storing and persisting objects to a file (JSON file) which will help with the storage engine.
